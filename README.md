# Graph Theory Algorithms

1) Connectedness and Components
  ------------------------------
    Input: Graph input given as Adjacency Matrix (edge exist = 1)
           Consider self loop = 0
           
    Output: Number of Components in the graph
            List of Components Obtained After Fusion
